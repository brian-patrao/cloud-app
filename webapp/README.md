# Web Application REST API Service

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the REST API service of our web application. Built using Java, Spring Boot, and Maven, this service offers a robust backend for managing and interacting with web resources.

## Prerequisites

- Java JDK 17 or higher
- Maven

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

### Build the Application

Use Maven to build the application:

```bash
./mvnw clean install
```

### Run the Application

To run the application, execute:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Alternatively, you can package the application and run the JAR file:

```bash
./mvnw package
java -jar target/<jar-file-name>
```

## API Endpoints

The REST API provides the following endpoints for managing resources:

- `GET /api/resource`: Retrieve a list of resources.
- `POST /api/resource`: Create a new resource.
- `GET /api/resource/{id}`: Retrieve a resource by its ID.
- `PUT /api/resource/{id}`: Update a resource by its ID.
- `DELETE /api/resource/{id}`: Delete a resource by its ID.

## Security

The API is secured using Spring Security. Ensure you have the appropriate authentication to access the endpoints.
